DontSpy is a multiple award-winning multi-platform messaging app using a new cryptographic approach developed at the [Student Research Center (SFZ) Südwürttemberg, Tuttlingen, Germany](https://sfz-bw.de/).

The project deals with the topic of secure communication within single and group conversations of predefined groups, ranging from encryption through software architecture to the software itself. Based on a refined symmetrical encryption, which makes static crypto analyses (i.e. frequency analyses) useless, the cross-platform-messaging app DontSpy allows a secure End-to-End encrypted communication. Common security-critical areas of connected communication are almost eliminated by the dissolution of persistent data sets at central areas and by additionally storing keys only in the secure sector of mobile terminals and by the secure hand-over of keys. Intellectual property stays - unlike other services like Facebook or Instagram - within the group.
DontSpy is developed object-orientated on the basis of new and established technologies such as Xamarin and the .NET standard are used. The app can be used in English or German depending on the language of the mobile terminal.
